whats a cell:A cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms It is the smallest entity that can carry out the processes of life
what is the function of the cell membrane:The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell maintaining its internal environment and protecting it from the external environment
what are mitochondria and what is their function:Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy through cellular respiration They are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of the cell
what does the golgi apparatus do:The Golgi apparatus processes modifies and sorts proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum preparing them for transport within or outside the cell
what is the cytoskeleton and why is it important:The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments that provides structural support helps maintain cell shape and aids in cell movement and intracellular transport
how do cells divide:Cells divide through a process called mitosis in somatic cells (for growth and repair) and meiosis in germ cells (for sexual reproduction)
what is apoptosis:Apoptosis is programmed cell death which is a crucial process for eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells and maintaining tissue homeostasis
