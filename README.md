About me

Hello I go by salade on the internet but my real names Noah. I enjoy computing, learning languages and playing video games. I first started coding during a highschool class where my computing teacher introduced me to Python. At the time i was just learning about chatbots such as CHATGPT and so i decided to develop my own chatbot named Abstract. Whilst not as clever as CHATGPT i do believe Abstract has his charms and as the catalyst for my programming love he holds a place in my heart. 

After spending many months learning about neural networks, AGI, Reinforcement learning and many other side projects I now bring you to my most recent and continuing projects:

- Prowler ( password brute forcing script)
- Drone physics simulator
- Biology simulator

I am now finding myself learning about all sorts from cyber security to computational biology I find it all very intersting and i hope you also benefit from my projects.

In school I also caused quite a bit of chaos as I decided to go pentester and found numerous vulnerabilities in the schools system that i ended up reporting. I have also surfed the dark web many a times and am familiar with cybersecurity.
